Alaskan Malamutes are still in use as sled dogs for personal travel, hauling freight, or helping move light objects; some, however, are used for the recreational pursuit of sledding, also known as mushing, as well as for skijoring, bikejoring, carting, and canicross.
However, most Malamutes today are kept  - as "family pets or as show or performance dogs in weight pulling, dog agility, or packing.
Malamutes are generally slower in long-distance dog sled racing against smaller and faster breeds, so their working usefulness is limited to freighting or traveling over long distances at a far slower rate than that required for racing.
They can also help move heavy objects over shorter distances. An adult male Alaskan Malamute can pull around 500 1,500 kilograms (1,100 3,300 lb) of weight, depending on build and training.
The Malamute has a long genetic foundation of living in harsh environments, and many of its behaviors have adapted to survive in such environments.
Independence, resourcefulness, high intelligence and natural behaviors are common in the breed.
Malamutes, like other Northern and sled dog breeds, can have a high prey drive, due to their origins and breeding.
This may mean in some cases they will chase smaller animals, including other canines, as well as rabbits, squirrels, and cats; however, this has been difficult to document in detail beyond anecdotal, observational data and many Malamute owners have observed varying levels of prey drive between individual dogs.
While Malamutes are, as a general rule, particularly amicable around people and can be taught to tolerate smaller pets, it is necessary to be mindful of them around smaller animals and small children.
